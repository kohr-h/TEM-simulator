To compile TEM-simulator, follow these steps.

1. Make sure you have FFTW version 3 installed.

2. If necessary, edit the first few lines in the Makefile
in the src directory, to specify the C compiler you want
to use, and the directory where FFTW is installed.

3. Compile by running make without any arguments in the
src directory. The executable called TEM-simulator should
appear in the same directory as the source files.

For details and information about running the program,
refer to the manual.
